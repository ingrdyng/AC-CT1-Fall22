# Week 5: Nonlinear Movement Assignment Thoughts

One of the biggest problem that came up while coding a non-linear movement idea was converting a template I found from The Imaginary Institute. From my very little knowledge of coding, I have seen some of the vocabulary used in Arduino or Processing world but not in p5.js. 

With that in mind, I had to learn the difference between the languages and understanding which belonged where. Some example of what I figured out was “void” would be “function” for p5.js, or pushMatrix() would just be push().
